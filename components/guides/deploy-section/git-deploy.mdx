To deploy with ZEIT Now, make sure your created project has been pushed to a Git repository.

Import the project into ZEIT Now from the ["Create a new project"](/new) page.

After your project has been imported, all subsequent pushes to branches will generate [Preview Deployments](docs/v2/platform/deployments#preview), and all changes made to the default branch (commonly "master") will result in a [Production Deployment](/docs/v2/platform/deployments#production).
