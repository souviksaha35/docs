ZEIT Now for GitHub uses the deployment API to bring you an extended user interface both in GitHub, when showing deployments, and Slack, if you have notifications setup using the [Slack GitHub app](https://slack.github.com).

You will see all of your deployments, production or preview, from within GitHub in its own page. See this page for the ZEIT documentation as an example: <https://github.com/zeit/docs/deployments>

Due to using GitHub's Deployments API, you will also be able to integrate with other services through [GitHub's checks](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-status-checks). Now will provide the deployment URL to the checks that require it, for example; to a testing suite such as [Checkly](https://checklyhq.com/docs/cicd/github/).
