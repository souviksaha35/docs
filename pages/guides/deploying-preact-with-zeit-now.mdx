[Preact](https://preactjs.com/) is a fast 3kB alternative to React with the same modern API.

In this guide, we will cover how to set up a Preact app with [Preact CLI](https://github.com/preactjs/preact-cli) and how to deploy it with [ZEIT Now](/docs/v2).

## Step 1: Set Up Your Preact Project

If you do not have the Preact CLI installed currently, use the following command to install it globally:

<Snippet dark text="npm i -g preact-cli" />

Get started by setting up a Preact app with Preact CLI and the following command:

<Snippet dark text="preact create default my-preact-app && cd my-preact-app" />

## Step 2: Deploying Your Preact Project with ZEIT Now

With your project set up, you are ready to deploy your Preact app with [ZEIT Now](/).

If you have not yet installed ZEIT Now, you can do so by [installing Now CLI](/download).

You can now deploy your Preact app with **a single command**:

<Snippet dark text="now" />

If you want to deploy your Preact project from a Git repository, you can use either [ZEIT Now for GitHub](/docs/v2/git-integrations/zeit-now-for-github), [ZEIT Now for GitLab](/docs/v2/git-integrations/zeit-now-for-gitlab), or [ZEIT Now for Bitbucket](/docs/v2/git-integrations/zeit-now-for-bitbucket) to have your project automatically deployed on every push, and the [production domain](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/custom-domains/#adding-a-domain) updated on push to master.
