ZEIT Now is a cloud platform for **static sites** and **Serverless Functions** that fits perfectly with your workflow. It enables developers to host **JAMstack** websites and web services that **deploy instantly**, **scale automatically**, and requires **no supervision**, all with **no configuration**.

## Deploy an Existing Project

Once you have [signed up to ZEIT](/signup), you can use our [Git integrations](/docs/v2/git-integration) with [GitHub](/docs/v2/more/now-for-github), [GitLab](/docs/v2/more/now-for-gitlab), or [Bitbucket](/docs/v2/more/now-for-bitbucket) to deploy an existing project – then with a deployment for every push – by selecting a repository from your Git account.

Connect through the ["New Project"](/new) page under the "From an existing project" section, and then from the same place, set up a project using your Git integration.

<Note>
  For more information on setting up Git to deploy with ZEIT and what you can do
  with it, see{' '}
  <Link color href="/docs/v2/git-integration">
    the Git integrations documentation
  </Link>
  .
</Note>

Alternatively, if you want to start fresh with a new project, use a Quickstart template from below. Additionally, you can use this method to start a new Git repository with any connected Git integration.

## Quickstarts

Quickstarts let you get started quickly. The following quickstarts are paired with guides and a deploy button, based on the example found in the [ZEIT Now repository](https://github.com/zeit/now/tree/master/examples), to help you get going with your project as fast as possible.

<Quickstarts>
  {quickstarts.map(({ name, ...quickstart }) => (
    <Quickstart quickstart={name} {...quickstart} />
  ))}
</Quickstarts>
